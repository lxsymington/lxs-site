## **Rough around the edges**

While building this site I wanted to use some more complex gradients as, being an engineer, I don't have much in the
way of images. One of the things that I tried experimenting with was drawing thin lines with CSS gradients. I did this
by making use of the widely adopted technique of declaring each color stop immediately after the previous one finished.
Lets have a quick look at some basic `linear-gradient`s.

For example:

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    transparent 0 calc(12.5px - 1px / var(--dpr)),
    black calc(12.5px - 1px / var(--dpr)) calc(12.5px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12.5px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

As is shown in the above example this produces decent results for horizontal and vertical lines.

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    45deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

Unfortunately I found this experimentation mostly produced poor results. Not one to be put off when things don't work
first time, I decided to have a go at improving the results.

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    30deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    120deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    60deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    150deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 11px 14px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    60deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    black 12px 13px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    150deg,
    transparent 0px 11px,
    black 12px 13px,
    transparent 14px 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```
