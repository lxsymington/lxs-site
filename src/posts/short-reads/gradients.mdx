## **Preamble**
As this is my first post I thought that I would start with something relatively simple. Given that I am currently
building this site and being an engineer I don't have much in the way of images, I have been using gradients in an
effort to make the site more visually appealing (hopefully something that I have achieved). As such I thought that I
would take this opportunity to look deeper into how they work and behave in CSS and what I have learnt about them.

## **Introduction**
### **Positives**
Gradients are a transition from one colour to one or more other colours over a specified distance. So why are gradients
interesting? For a start when used as backgrounds they can bring more visual depth and texture than their flat
counterparts. Creating visual depth can help to break up content, making it more approachable and therefore consumable.
Appropriate use of gradients can also be used to draw attention to key content by making it more stimulating as well as
intelligent use of light.

### **Negatives**
Gradients do also have their downsides. As much as they can draw attention to key areas, as well as help to contextually
separate content when used well, they can also be distracting and divert users away from key content. Another area
gradients *can*, but do not necessarily need to, cause problems is accessibility. Much the same as with text over
images, text over gradients can often cause readability issues. The readability issues often arise from a lack of
contrast between the text/foreground colour and the colour of the background over which it is presented. Unfortunately
this is still a common issue on the web even when using flat colours, let alone when text is displayed ove a background that has
multiple colours such as an image or gradient. With a little thought and a modicum of effort though there is usually
ample opportunity to improve the situation for everyone!

_It has been fairly widely acknowledged that the web needs to more to be accessible to all users, as accessibility
benefits everyone often in ways that are not immediately obvious. As a Frontend engineer and someone who spends most of
their time working, creating user interfaces, I want to ensure that accessible practices are always considered. I am
very much at the start of the journey towards incorporating accessible practices as a default as opposed to
retrospectively, but hopefully with a little learning, a little feedback and some time I will get there._

## **Foundations**
As touched upon earlier in this post in the context of CSS gradients, a gradient is a transition from a colour to one or
more colours over a specified distance. What was not discussed at that point was the direction of that transition. In
gradients generally that is not important however in CSS gradients there are currently 6 varieties of gradient which can be
divided into 3 categories:

 - **Linear**
   CSS `linear-gradient`s can be thought of as being unidirectional, as in they transition from a start point to an end
   point along the straight line that connects them. 

 - **Radial**
   CSS `radial-gradient`s can be thought of as being omnidirectional, as in they transition from a start point in all
   directions up to a specified distance from the start point. How this distance is specified is a little more
   complicated than it is for linear gradients, therefore it is something that I will revisit later on in this post.

 - **Conic**
   CSS `conic-gradient`s are a little more different from the other 2 varieties in that they do not transition along (a)
   straight line(s). Instead they transition from a start angle to an end angle about a specified point.

For the sake of clarity, I would like to take a moment to explain what I mean by the _"double stop technique"_. **_Fig.
1_** is an example of what is probably the simplest implementation of a CSS `linear-gradient`.

```css caption=Simple_Gradient
/* Sample Comment */
background-image: linear-gradient( black, transparent);
```

In **_fig. 1_** there are two `color-stop`s the first stop `black` and the last stop `transparent`. In this instance the
`color-stop` positions have been omitted for simplicity, the result is that the first and last stops are placed at the
start (0%) an end (100%) of the gradient line respectively. If we do set the positions for the `color-stop`s we can
reduce the size of the transition between the two colours as shown in **_fig. 2_**.

```css caption=Positioned_Color_Stop_Gradient
background-image: linear-gradient( black 25%, transparent 75%);
```

## **Rough around the edges**

If we continue to move the `color-stop` positions closer together, eventually we get to the point where they share the
same position.

For example:

```css caption=Vertical_and_Horizontal_Gradient_Lines
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

As is shown in the above example this produces decent results for horizontal and vertical lines.

```css caption=45_degree_Gradient_Lines
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    45deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

Unfortunately I found this experimentation mostly produced poor results. Not one to be put off when things don't work
first time, I decided to have a go at improving the results.

```css caption=30_degree_Gradient_Lines
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    30deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    120deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css caption=60_degree_Gradient_Lines
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    60deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    150deg,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css caption=Graded_60_degree_Gradient_Lines
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    60deg,
    transparent 0 11px,
    calc(11px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    black,
    calc(11px + 2px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(11px + 3px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    150deg,
    transparent 0px 11px,
    calc(11px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    black,
    calc(11px + 2px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(11px + 3px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css caption=Circular_Radial_Gradient
background-image:
  repeating-radial-gradient(
    circle at 50% 50%,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css caption=Graded_Circular_Radial_Gradient
background-image:
  repeating-radial-gradient(
    circle at 50% 50%,
    transparent 0 11px,
    calc(11px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    black,
    calc(11px + 2px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(11px + 3px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css caption=Elliptical_Radial_Gradient
background-image:
  repeating-radial-gradient(
    ellipse at 50% 50%,
    transparent 0 12px,
    black 12px calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(12px + 1px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```

```css caption=Graded_Elliptical_Radial_Gradient
background-image:
  repeating-radial-gradient(
    ellipse at 50% 50%,
    transparent 0 11px,
    calc(11px + 1px / var(--dpr)),
    black,
    calc(11px + 2px / var(--dpr)),
    transparent calc(11px + 3px / var(--dpr)) 25px
  );
background-position: center;
```
