# Rough around the edges

While building this site I wanted to use some more complex gradients since, being an engineer, I don't have much in the
way of images. One of the things that I tried experimenting with was drawing thin lines with CSS gradients. I did this
by making use of the widely adopted technique of declaring each color stop immediately after the previous one finished.
For example:

```css live=true
() => <div style={{
backgroundImage: `repeating-linear-gradient(
  60deg,
  transparent 0 2px,
  black 2px 3px,
  transparent 3px 5px
)`,
width: `100%`,
height: `100%`,
}}></div>
```

<div style="background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
    60deg,
    transparent 0 2px,
    black 2px 3px,
    transparent 3px 5px
  ); height: 260px; width: 260px;">Example</div>

Unfortunately I found this experimentation mostly produced poor results. Not one to be put off when things don't work
first time, I decided to have a go at improving the results.
