# Rough around the edges

While building this site I wanted to use some more complex gradients as, being an engineer, I don't have much in the
way of images. One of the things that I tried experimenting with was drawing thin lines with CSS gradients. I did this
by making use of the widely adopted technique of declaring each color stop immediately after the previous one finished.
Lets have a quick look at some basic `linear-gradient`s.

For example:

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    black 2px 3px,
    transparent 3px 5px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    black 2px 3px,
    transparent 3px 5px
  );
```

As is shown in the above example this produces decent results for horizontal and vertical lines.

```css
background-image:
  repeating-linear-gradient(
+   45deg,
    black 2px 3px,
    transparent 3px 5px
  ),
  repeating-linear-gradient(
-   90deg,
+   135deg,
    black 2px 3px,
    transparent 3px 5px
  );
```

Unfortunately I found this experimentation mostly produced poor results. Not one to be put off when things don't work
first time, I decided to have a go at improving the results.
